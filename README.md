Build a html form with the following elements. The form must be within a table structure.
• Name: a text box where the content contains no special character (i.e. !, @, #, $, %, &, *).
Number is allowed. The text box must not be empty.
• Module code: a text box where the content must start with 3 lower case alphabets and
follows by 4 digits. This textbox can be empty.
• Current date: a non-editable textbox and should be in the format as shown (e.g. 12 October
2020 Monday 3:35 PM). The content is the current date or today’s date which will change
every day.
• Message: a text area with 3 rows and 20 columns. The default text is “Hello 202204”. The
text area cannot be empty.
• Find: a text box for the user to key in text he/she wants to find.
• Replace: a text box for the user to key in the replacement text. If the find text is empty, this
element should be disable (i.e. user cannot key in anything here).
• Find and Replace: This is a button, when click, it will go to the “Message” text area to find all
the occurrence of the text shown in the “Find” text box and replaces all of them with the
content shown in the “Replace” text box. After the replacement, a message showing the
number of replacements must be displayed besides the button.
• Source language: a selection list with English, Malay, Japanese and Korean. Use English as
the default.
• Target language: a radio button with English, Chinese, Malay, Japanese and Korean. Make
Japanese as the default.
• Submit button: the button is called “Translate”. When it is clicked, it should invoke the
google translate https://translate.google.com to perform the translation of the content in
the “Message” text area as described above.
• Reset button: this will reset the content of all the elements.
